  you intend to store. (10 pts)

1) We will be using an Azure SQL Server Database, imdbdata.database.windows.com
2) See question 1.
3) We chose it because it allowed all of us to have good accessibility to the DB, learn something new, and familiarize
    ourselves with cloud hosted database services. We chose SQL Server because its what we use in the Hunstman School
     database courses so we all have familiarity with it.
     
 1) The database is set up on Azure at imdbdata.databasecom
 2) See below script.
